  Here are some notes on how to use markdown with examples
---
## above here is the metadata...in the .Rmd file
pound sign defines a header

## settings for the file
by changing inclue to false it will hide this code 
```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	echo = TRUE,
	message = FALSE,
	warning = FALSE,
	comment = NA
)
```

# big header
## smaller header
### even smaller header
text in here is just text in the body of your document 

you can set the output to basically anything from a pdf to a ppt, you just define these in the output settings 

# making a list
dash before text makes a list

- tile = title,
- author = defines aithors with affiliations and a url for the author,
- date = date,
- output = the output options that you will knit to
  - toc = table of contents,
  - toc float = where the table of contents will go,
  - theme = how the file will look,
  - distill::distill_article: = specific formatting for html files, bookdown is just a dif way of formatting 
    - the further you tab over
      - means you can make
        - sub
          - points
```{r echo=TRUE}
#libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
```

# making a figure caption
```{r echo=TRUE}
cap <- "caption"
```

# here is an example of some code you can put in (hotkey: cmd+option+i)
```{r name, echo=TRUE, fig.cap= cap}
cty.plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(cty)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 25) +
  theme_light()
cty.plot
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
hwy.plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 25) +
  theme_light()
hwy.plot
```

Figure \@ref(fig:name) !!!

# GRAPHICS
some graphics setting 
```{r echo=TRUE}
# some options for how you output things
# fig.retina=x 
# out.width=x%
# fig.width/fig.height/fig.asp
# you can also use ggsave here to manually define things within ggsave
# external image
# knitr::include_graphics(here::here("location/name of image.jpg"))
```

# putting figures together
```{r}
# one way
plot_grid(cty.plot, hwy.plot, labels = "AUTO", ncol = 1)
#another way using patchwork 
cty.plot + hwy.plot
```

# saving figures 
```{r save plot, fig.path = "figures/", echo = TRUE}
# option to save a plot above 
displ.plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 25) +
  theme_light()
displ.plot

# using ggsave 
```
